# Development Process Documentation

This document outlines my approach, challenges, and decisions made during the development of the High-Value Link Scraper project.

## Project Planning

### Initial Assessment

I began by breaking down the key requirements:
1. Create a web scraper to identify high-value links
2. Implement intelligent link prioritization
3. Store the data with appropriate metadata
4. Build an API to access the scraped information

The biggest technical challenge was how to efficiently identify "high-value" links without crawling everything or sending too many requests to expensive API services.

### Technology Choices

I selected technologies based on efficiency and appropriateness for the task:

- **FireCrawl API**: For efficient web crawling with minimal code
- **OpenAI API**: For intelligent link classification
- **FastAPI**: For a modern, high-performance API
- **SQLite**: For simple, configuration-free data storage
- **SQLAlchemy**: For ORM capabilities and database abstraction

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Crawling & Structure

I started by setting up:
- Project directory structure
- Configuration management
- FireCrawl integration for basic crawling
- Database models for websites and links

This phase established the foundation for data collection and storage.

### Phase 2: Link Processing & Prioritization

The core intelligence of the system came from:
1. A two-stage approach to minimize API costs:
   - Initial heuristic-based assessment to filter out obviously low-value links
   - OpenAI-powered detailed analysis for promising candidates

2. Customized scoring for different link types:
   - Document files (.pdf, .xlsx, etc.)
   - URLs containing financial/government keywords
   - Special handling for .gov domains

### Phase 3: API Development

The API was designed with these priorities:
- Clean RESTful endpoints
- Flexible filtering options
- Proper error handling
- Statistics and search capabilities

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: FireCrawl API Integration

**Problem**: The FireCrawl API response structure was different than initially expected, causing issues with link extraction.

**Solution**: I studied the actual API response format and updated the code to properly handle the returned data structure, focusing on extracting links from both the explicit 'links' array and the metadata.

### Challenge 2: Low Initial Scores

**Problem**: Initial scoring was too restrictive, especially for government websites, resulting in many potentially valuable links being missed.

**Solution**: I implemented:
- Special handling for .gov domains
- Higher baseline scores
- Path-based boosting for finance/budget related sections
- An expanded keyword list

### Challenge 3: Database Integration

**Problem**: Encountered SQLAlchemy metadata conflicts with property naming.

**Solution**: Renamed the property from 'metadata' to 'link_metadata' to avoid collision with SQLAlchemy's internal metadata attribute.

## Optimization & Performance Considerations

### API Cost Management

To minimize OpenAI API costs while maintaining quality:
- Implemented tiered approach (only ~40% of links need AI analysis)
- Batch processing to reduce API calls
- Caching to prevent reanalyzing known links

### Crawl Efficiency

To optimize the crawling process:
- Set reasonable page limits (default 10)
- Implemented proper error handling and retries
- Used asynchronous crawling through FireCrawl

## Scaling Considerations

For scaling to production levels:
- **Distributed Processing**: The architecture supports distributed crawling with queue systems
- **Database Migration**: Code is designed to work with both SQLite (dev) and production databases
- **Modular Design**: Components are separated for easy scaling of individual parts

## Future Work

With additional time, I would add:
1. **Content Analysis**: Analyze page content, not just URLs
2. **Historical Tracking**: Track links over time to identify new high-value content
3. **Custom ML Model**: Train a specialized model for even more accurate classification
4. **Web Interface**: Add a dashboard for exploring discovered links
5. **Document Indexing**: Index and make searchable the content of documents

## Testing Approach

I tested the system on several government websites including:
- a2gov.org
- bozeman.net
- boerneisd.net

This helped fine-tune the scoring algorithm and keyword list for these types of sites.

## Conclusions

This project demonstrates an effective approach to intelligent web scraping through:
1. **Smart Resource Usage**: Minimizing expensive operations without sacrificing quality
2. **Adaptable Architecture**: Designing for both development and production environments
3. **Domain-Specific Optimization**: Tailoring algorithms for the specific domain (government/financial sites)

The system successfully identifies high-value links that would be difficult to find through manual searching, providing significant value for users looking for financial documents and contact information on complex websites.
